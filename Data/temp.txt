<Content>Old seattle getaway This was Old World Excellence at it's best.THIS is the place to stay at when visiting the historical area of Seattle. Your right on the water front near the ferry's and great sea food restraunts,and still with'in walking distance for great blues and jazz music. The staff for this hotel are excellent,they make you feel right at home. The breakfast was great.We did'nt have to travel far to have a good cup of JOE and a light meal to start our adventurous day off into one of the most beautifull city's in america. This hotel is in an area that makes it easy to get to any place you want to go and still find your way back, I highly recomend this hotel for your next visit to seattle.

<Content>Perfect after an Alaskan Cruise The perfect stop after an Alaskan cruise on NCL. Took all the hassle out of getting home. They had a computer for pre-boarding on SWA. We got into our room early and were able to enjoy Seattle on foot before our flight out the next day.

<Content>Nice hotel but..... Very nice hotel, well remodelled and tasteful accommodations. Staff was helpful, polite and unobtrusive. The major problem is the number and outright in your face quality of the derelicts that inhabit every street corner, bench, and doorway of the Pioneer Square area. To be forced to watch so that you dont step in someones urine trail, to have to turn your back so as to not have to watch a derelict urinate in broad daylight on the biulding on a main street, to have to PUSH one of them away from me when he kept circling back closer and closer to me, is TOO MUCH.I will never stay in downtown Seattle again. Well over a hundred dollars and you are a prisoner in your hotel. The derelicts have taken over Pioneer Square. They own their benches, doorways, and covered areas. They own Pioneer Square.Wake up Seattle and take your city back.Guess I will be staying at the airport nextime. Lots of good restaurants and shops that are loosing customers due to the prevalence of these derelicts.
